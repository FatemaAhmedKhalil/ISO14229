### UDS Implementation following ISO14229 Standard

🚀 Exciting News Alert! 🚀

Are you ready for some groundbreaking news? We've embarked on an incredible journey diving into the world of Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) based on the ISO14229 standard. But what truly sets this project apart? The invaluable guidance and support from none other than Islam Adel. Let's delve into the details:

🔍 Deep Dive into ISO14229: Our journey began with an in-depth exploration of the ISO14229 standard. Understanding every intricate detail was essential to ensure the success of our UDS implementation.

💡 Development of UDS Services: We've developed a comprehensive set of UDS services, each playing a vital role in diagnostics:
- Diagnostic Session Control (0x10)
- ECU Reset (0x11)
- Security Access (0x27)
- Tester Present (0x3E)
- Read Data By Identifier (0x22)
- Write Data By Identifier (0x2E)
- Request Download (0x34)
- Transfer Data (0x36)
- Request Transfer Exit (0x37)

🔄 Pointer-to-Function Magic: Leveraging the power of pointer-to-function techniques, we've seamlessly integrated functionality into our system, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

🐍 Python Scripting for Efficiency: To further optimize efficiency and promote interoperability, we've developed Python scripts for streamlined command transmission and reception. These scripts have significantly elevated the efficiency of our system.
